<p>Welcome, internet wanderer! My general area of interest is CPU
archutectures and toolchains supporting them. I know a little bit about
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a>
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell">Haskell</a>.</p>

<p>I occasionally blog about the things I encounter. Mostly for general
amusement. Enjoy!</p>
